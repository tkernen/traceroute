# History

Traceroute.org was born back in 1996/1997. It morphed from my Netscape Navigator bookmarks collection of tracreroute, looking glass and BGP related tools that I used when I was administrating AS8327.

I figured out that the collection of URLs could be of use to the netops community as a whole, and hence traceroute.org was set up. I actively maintained it until the early 2010s when my $dayjob and personal life overran my spare time to dedicate to maintaining the ressource.

In late 2022, I've move the static HTML single page to a community focused approach. GitHub for the backend to provide an opportunity for everyone to submit updates, comments and suggestions that can then be pulled via a simple commit.

I hope this resource can still be of use to the netops community for many more years
